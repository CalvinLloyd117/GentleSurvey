Next, consider listing other members of your academic community that you frequently interact with as a student. These could include other non-lab students or classmates, previous supervisors or mentors, other professors, instructors, or departmental staff. You are also free to list individuals from your non-academic environment that you interact with as a student (e.g., non-academic mentors, professional affiliates, employers, family, friends, or partners). You can include individuals that you interact with either in-person, phone, email, or other online platforms. <b>You should be able to recognize all these individuals by face or name, and they should be able to recognize you by face or name.</b></p>
        <p>Give everyone a name that is unique and easily recognizable to you (e.g., nicknames, initials, or pseudonyms). It is important that you will be
            able to easily identify all 25 individuals by their name in a future survey. Note that you must list 25 individuals to proceed through the survey,
            so please continue listing individuals until you reach 25. Itâ€™s ok if those individuals at the end of your list are only minimally connected to you. </p></div>,
